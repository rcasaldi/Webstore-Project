<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>COMMON FAQs</strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; color: #333399;"><strong>My order was declined, why did I receive a gateway error page and why I was charged?</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Credit Card approval requires an address match to the billing address you enter, when completing an order, and the billing address your bank has on file for that card. Repeated attempts to place an order with incorrect information will place various holds of funds on that card.&nbsp;If your order did not go through and got declined, the charges are pending and not actual charges. These pre-authorizations will "fall off" at your banks discretion.&nbsp;Please do not get alarmed, if the charge is determined to be declined or pending charges, it will be cancelled and the funds should go back to your account in a few days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">If you did not receive an order number immediately after attempting to purchase then the transaction was unsuccessful and did not go through.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; color: #333399;"><strong>When will my package be sent out? When will I receive a shipping confirmation?</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Our shipping department located in the King's Landing area works hard to get every customer's order shipped out as soon as possible during business hours.

Once this period is completed, the tracking information will automatically be sent out through email to show that it is ready for shipment.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;">During times of increased orders, such as holiday seasons or exclusive promotions, the processing period may be longer than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large; color: #333399;"><strong>How do I make changes to my orders?</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Once an order is placed, it cannot be modified or cancelled.
